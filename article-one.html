                This is the content for my first article......I am Bidyashree Rout. I read in IIIT BHUBANESWAR.

                I am a sincere, honest and dedicated girl.
                I love to study and I am good at academics. I am a music lover too. I learn hindustani classical music.

                I am a positive person but sometimes I lose my patience and get impatient when I am stuck in a problem.
                I like to learn new things and right now I am enjoying this course on app development conducted by NPTEL.
                I have learnt many new concepts on databases and security as of now and I am looking forward to learn more.....
